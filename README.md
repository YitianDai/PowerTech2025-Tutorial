# Assessing Resilience in Modern Energy Systems ‚Äì PowerTech Tutorial 2025

## Overview üìã

This hands-on tutorial provides a complete workflow for assessing the resilience of power systems against extreme weather events. Participants will learn by modeling a realistic power network, simulating a physical hazard, and quantifying the system's operational response.

### What You‚Äôll Learn

* Core concepts of power system modeling and resilience.
* Modeling a large-scale synthetic power grid (Texas 2000-bus system).
* Generating and visualizing spatio-temporal hazard scenarios (windstorms).
* Applying fragility models to determine component failure probabilities.
* Running Monte Carlo simulations and DC Optimal Power Flow (DC-OPF).
* Quantifying resilience using metrics like Energy Not Supplied (ENS).
* Modeling and evaluating the impact of distribution-side flexibility.

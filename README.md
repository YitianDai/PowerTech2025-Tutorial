# Assessing Resilience in Modern Energy Systems ‚Äì PowerTech Tutorial 2025

## Overview üìã

This hands-on tutorial provides a complete workflow for assessing the resilience of power systems against extreme weather events. Participants will learn by modeling a realistic power network, simulating a physical hazard, and quantifying the system's operational response.

### What You‚Äôll Learn

* Core concepts of power system modeling and resilience.
* Modeling a large-scale synthetic power grid (Texas 2000-bus system).
* Generating and visualizing spatio-temporal hazard scenarios (windstorms).
* Applying fragility models to determine component failure probabilities.
* Running Monte Carlo simulations and DC Optimal Power Flow (DC-OPF).
* Quantifying resilience using metrics like Energy Not Supplied (ENS).
* Modeling and evaluating the impact of distribution-side flexibility.

## Getting Started üõ†Ô∏è

### ‚úÖ Recommended Platform: [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/YitianDai/PowerTech2025-Tutorial.git/master)

This tutorial is designed to be run in a live, interactive environment using Binder, which requires no local installation. Binder uses the `environment.yml` file in this repository to build the environment.

#### Running the Notebooks with Binder

1.  Click the **"Launch Binder"** badge above.
2.  Binder will build the necessary environment. This may take a few minutes on the first launch.
3.  Once ready, a Jupyter interface will open in your browser.
4.  Open the notebooks in the following order, starting with `SE01`.

### Alternative: Local Jupyter Environment

If you prefer to run the notebooks locally:

#### What You Need
* A `conda` installation
* Python 3.8+

#### Local Setup
1.  Clone or download this repository.
2.  Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3.  Create the conda environment from the `environment.yml` file:
    ```bash
    conda env create -f environment.yml
    ```
4.  Activate the newly created environment:
    ```bash
    conda activate resilience_assessment
    ```
5.  Start Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
